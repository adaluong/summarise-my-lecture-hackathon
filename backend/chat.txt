-14:09 | (Owner) Marc Chee: Good Morning!
-13:05 | Izy Z: Morning! 
-7:30 | Srikar Danthurty: hey marc do you know if there any comp courses in unsw that teach R?
-5:12 | (Moderator) Michael Gribben: hi
-5:00 | (Owner) Marc Chee: I don't know sorry . . . I've barely heard of R and had to look it up just then! But that doesn't mean that no one's teaching it
-4:28 | (Owner) Marc Chee: There are actually a lot of courses even in CSE that I don't know the details of (or what specific language they're using)
-4:03 | (Owner) Marc Chee: Hi @Michael Gribben 
-3:46 | Lorenzo Grillo: morning!!!
-3:41 | Blake Morris: Good morning :)
-2:40 | (Moderator) Michael Gribben: Hello @Marc Chee 
-1:21 | (Moderator) Michael Gribben: I think DATA1001 has some R - no idea how much depth it goes into it
-0:39 | Srikar Danthurty: yeh haha im doing data science so thats why i was asking
-0:24 | Joseph Wong: Hello!
1:28 | Tao Tao: Tired af 
1:36 | (Moderator) Michael Gribben: audio is good 🙂
1:43 | Markus N: ^
2:08 | Blake Morris: sameeee
2:45 | Markus N: feels like only 2 days after the 1st assignment
3:05 | (Moderator) Michael Gribben: https://cgi.cse.unsw.edu.au/~cs1511/21T1/assignments/ass2/index.html
3:21 | (Moderator) Michael Gribben: Assignment 2 ^^ autotests should be working...
3:26 | Hussain Nawaz: Day after math exam 😞
4:06 | Markus N: same lmao
4:46 | Zihang Xu: all of the students will do final exam at the same time?
4:53 | Markus N: the exam timetable still says we have to consult the school for times
5:17 | Bhuvanish Mutharia: just think of it as a 4 week holiday 
5:26 | Lorenzo Grillo: hmmm 
5:29 | (Moderator) Michael Gribben: @Markus N the course will release more info later about the exact time but the date is now set
5:42 | Joseph Wong: don't worry, you can bump up our marks even if they dont drop?
5:54 | (Moderator) Michael Gribben: @Zihang Xu yep (except for special considerations)
6:01 | Cameron Mayhew: Is it a 2 hour exam?
6:12 | Leo Shi: is the exam 6 hours long?
6:19 | Markus N: oh god 1pm in sydney, this means 11 am, no lunch for me i guess
6:21 | Hussain Nawaz: @Bhuvanish Mutharia The thought of not having any schoolwork for 4 weeksd is frightening
6:39 | Tao Tao: h u h
6:49 | TEJ4321 Tejas: wait so how long is it
6:56 | Bhuvanish Mutharia: @Hussain Nawaz you're built different ong. I'm counting down the days to holidays
7:07 | Mag1c: So its essentially a lab
7:17 | Zihang Xu: Won't vlab crash while so many students are using
7:25 | Tao Tao: a longass lab
7:40 | Markus N: are there any past exams for reference?
7:51 | Tao Tao: they give you extra time for how laggy vlab can get
7:57 | Hussain Nawaz: @Bhuvanish Mutharia Very desperately need a holiday, I know 2-3 weeks in i will be begging to come back and have something to do
8:04 | (Moderator) Michael Gribben: The self-tests are great practice for the final exam 🙂
8:35 | Leo Shi: will we be able to use autotests in the final exam?
8:56 | Markus N: usually how many lines of code do we have to pump out in the exam
9:24 | Zijie Li: By the way what did you guys get in the mid-term exam last week.
9:35 | (Moderator) Michael Gribben: @Leo Shi very likely be autotests (having said that I'm not involved in the exam...)
9:46 | Jordan Terz: 69
9:48 | Jordan Terz: wby
9:49 | Charzinc: haha 0
9:50 | Hussain Nawaz: @Zijie Li please no, not again
9:59 | Bhuvanish Mutharia: @Hussain Nawaz just party bro. it's not that hard
10:27 | Mack n Cheese: ...midterm?
10:35 | Mack n Cheese: oh ok
11:01 | Justin Kim: this exam
11:06 | Mack n Cheese: :(
11:33 | Zijie Li: I watched the lecture during weekend and thought I missed out the "void" exam
11:49 | Mack n Cheese: can't believe I got got a week later
14:04 | Cameron Mayhew: ooo isn't this a challenge exercise in the labs?
14:12 | Cameron Mayhew: inserting not into the head
14:18 | (Moderator) Michael Gribben: ms paint time 😛
14:31 | (Moderator) Michael Gribben: yep 🙂
14:56 | Tao Tao: oh god no
14:59 | Sarthak Jain: pen pineapple apple pen
15:00 | Justin Kim: 2016 baby
15:01 | Lorenzo Grillo: OMG
15:04 | Sarthak Jain: lol
15:05 | Cameron Mayhew: next year's april fools??
15:05 | Lorenzo Grillo: that needs to happen
15:06 | JianFeng Lin: ❤
15:07 | TEJ4321 Tejas: please do it
15:10 | JianFeng Lin: My fav
15:14 | Markus N: marc chee cosplay stream when
15:18 | TEJ4321 Tejas: the colours are gonna match the marccoin
15:22 | Ben Godw: ppap was 5 years ago 😞
15:36 | Justin Kim: let's plays marc plays genshin
17:20 | Keith: ur imagination
17:32 | Joseph Wong: the hardware specs of my brain are pretty low
17:39 | Matthew Richards: nginx with the quad ref pointer
17:57 | Keith: how much ram in ur brain @Joseph Wong ?
18:17 | joshablob: 1gbof rammmm
18:30 | TheletterG: remember to download more ram for the next assingment! 
18:31 | Jieshun Wang: neural networks 😲😲😲
18:32 | Joseph Wong: my brain has 20mb ram and 1gb storage
18:51 | (Moderator) Michael Gribben: i hear the brain has a very good graphics card
19:38 | TEJ4321 Tejas: guess my brain doesn't exist then @Michael Gribben 
19:40 | Blake Morris: mine needs a new power supply
19:48 | Mack n Cheese: it only lets you see 380nm to 750nm smh
20:12 | Lorenzo Grillo: does head->next->next work as pointer to 3rd element in list?
20:48 | Lorenzo Grillo: @Marc Chee 
21:00 | (Moderator) Michael Gribben: yep should be... assuming nothing was NULL
21:13 | Blake Morris: Yes
21:25 | Lorenzo Grillo: ok cool!
21:26 | (Moderator) Michael Gribben: if something was NULL then computer go crash
21:30 | Joseph Wong: marc chee is doxxing me
22:15 | Blake Morris: after exam party at 200 anzadc
22:26 | TheletterG: for assingment 3 we code viruses and then sewnd them to elderly people
22:41 | William Papantoniou: just an idea for searching algorithms, could you have pointers to middle sections of the linked list? because if its sorted you would be able to reduce the search time
23:21 | Hussain Nawaz: If you overshoot head -> next -> next -> will it return null or error?
23:21 | Matthew Richards: @William Papantoniou Yes... but generally not useful because it's easier to just loop through it.
23:22 | (Moderator) Michael Gribben: interesting idea! I suppose you could...
24:08 | Matthew Richards: @Hussain Nawaz going overboard with the ->next will result in a seg fault. Eventually they'll return NULL but you need to check for that
24:40 | William Papantoniou: @Matthew Richards ahh its usefulness would be determined by the length of the linked list, for n nodes you would need to perform n actions to search from start to end without a middle pointer, 
24:46 | (Moderator) Michael Gribben: @William Papantoniou It's cool what you're suggesting because it sounds very similar to binary search, although the best way to store a list like that is talked about in COMP2521
24:47 | William Papantoniou: but if you have a middle pointer it becomes n/2
24:49 | Hussain Nawaz: @Matthew Richards seg fault?
25:07 | Lorenzo Grillo: @Marc Chee i couldn't find an answer online - given that all the C standard libraries we use are .h files, what are the corresponding C implementation files?
25:17 | Matthew Richards: @Hussain Nawaz dereferencing a null pointer causes a sed fault
25:21 | Matthew Richards: *seg
25:22 | Justin Kim: lol yes
25:24 | (Moderator) Michael Gribben: A seg fault is when you access an invalid memory access (ie NULL) - dcc doesn't show you seg faults
25:31 | FEIYUE MA: yes
25:40 | Olli Bowers: helo
25:41 | (Moderator) Michael Gribben: Instead of a seg fault, it gives you a far less confusing error message
25:41 | Matthew Richards: @Lorenzo Grillo Those files aren't written in C. They are written in assembly
26:06 | Lorenzo Grillo: oh ok 
26:08 | Lorenzo Grillo: cool
26:17 | Anneliese Menday: literally have been rewatching avatar 
26:26 | Charzinc: can someone please explain what typedef does?
26:28 | Charzinc: I forgot
26:47 | Hussain Nawaz: @Charzinc defines a new type that you can use in your code
26:52 | Cameron Mayhew: It basically just makes a new type like int or char
26:54 | Matthew Richards: It's actually really hard to find the exact implementations but glibc has one you can browse for common functions.
27:01 | Charzinc: ty
27:02 | Cameron Mayhew: but for your specific purpose so its pretty useful for structs
27:38 | (Moderator) Michael Gribben: @Lorenzo Grillo the standard libraries like stdio.h and string.h are written in C and are stored in a very special place on your computer
28:11 | Blake Morris: A very special place - recycling bin
28:11 | (Moderator) Michael Gribben: The computer probably only stored the compiled code (ie binary)
28:26 | Matthew Richards: actually the .h exposes libraries written in assembly (generally) 
28:45 | DeLuX∆: when do the last two lectures get uploaded
29:17 | DeLuX∆: yep
29:41 | EdIsAmbro: marc chee is not an android?
29:46 | Evan Williams: i can see them @DeLuX∆ 
30:35 | (Moderator) Michael Gribben: By special place I mean /usr/lib/ - @Matthew Richards yes sorry - what I meant is that they are implemented in C, although your computer stores the assembly
31:28 | (Moderator) Michael Gribben: @DeLuX∆ the last week's lectures (lecture 11 and lecture 12) are on youtube I think?
31:33 | (Moderator) Michael Gribben: can you see them?
31:50 | Lorenzo Grillo: didn't #include stdio.h
32:51 | (Moderator) Michael Gribben: typedef is kind of like #define but for types. It likes you refer to complex types things struct node * with a shorter name
34:18 | Matthew Richards: It should also be noted that high performance sections of the standard library are generally written with bare assembly. e.g. math.h functions.
36:14 | Kaan Sahiner: in Assignment 2 I didn't see which topics we are alowed to use, are these included?
36:52 | Cameron Mayhew: We will definitely need linked lists for the assignment @Kaan Sahiner 
37:14 | Kaan Sahiner: Alrighty thanks
37:14 | (Moderator) Michael Gribben: yep ^^
37:57 | Kaan Sahiner: need to practice these more I don't get them much ;/
38:07 | TEJ4321 Tejas: ahh the arrow in the middle is slightly tilted
38:32 | Cameron Mayhew: I don't think anyone does ahahha thats why we have a few lectures on them @Kaan Sahiner 
39:55 | Markus N: am i the only one feeling like i need to rewatch the lecture a 100 more times to understand this
40:04 | (Moderator) Michael Gribben: ^^ We're not expecting you to understand linked lists instantly 🙂 That would be insane.
40:37 | Kaan Sahiner: yeah I think I'll start the assignment when the lectures are done and I'll rewatch them over and over]
40:52 | Matthew Richards: dw pointer stuff is really hard to understand if you've never encountered them before (e.g. linked lists, trees and other complex structures)
41:22 | Kaan Sahiner: @Markus N same 
43:05 | Lorenzo Grillo: yeah TODO highlights itself
43:07 | Lorenzo Grillo: epic
43:30 | Cameron Mayhew: Is this comp1511 colors or is this a gedit thing?
44:01 | Matthew Richards: gedit thing
44:11 | (Moderator) Michael Gribben: gedit 🙂
44:53 | Blake Morris: anyone know of a good vscode extension that highlights todo in c?
45:38 | Hussain Nawaz: ^Highlights "TODO:" and ""FIXME:"
46:32 | Matthew Richards: just search for todo in the marketplace
48:33 | Jennie Nguyen: its ok ur writing it in cursive
53:27 | Lorenzo Grillo: what if we give insert_pos == NULL?
53:44 | Lorenzo Grillo: wouldn't that break? @Marc Chee 
54:03 | (Moderator) Michael Gribben: yes...
54:23 | Lorenzo Grillo: like if you want to insert at the start, can you not do that?
54:58 | Zijie Li: I think we just change the head if we insert at the start
55:46 | (Moderator) Michael Gribben: yep 🙂 We'll have to check if insert_pos is NULL and do different things if it is NULL
57:06 | Cameron Mayhew: but not if we start at the front ;0
1:02:58 | Scire Schroedinger: The null void
1:05:04 | Lorenzo Grillo: break time?
1:05:37 | Hamish Cox: why not just return the new one every time? this seems like it would be a pain to use.
1:06:26 | (Moderator) Michael Gribben: you could 🙂
1:06:30 | Blake Morris: \br
1:06:35 | Jman: ALPHAGO
1:06:36 | Jman: YESSSS
1:06:53 | Hussain Nawaz: Alphago is a documentary that felt like an anime
1:06:53 | TEJ4321 Tejas: oh alphago
1:06:54 | Blake Morris: HR Machine is awesome
1:07:22 | Jman: "If deepmind can write code without bugs, that's bigger news than Alphago"
1:07:25 | Brendon Z: I recommend Rendezvous with Rama by Arthur C. Clarke🙂 
1:07:46 | Matthew Richards: Asimov!!
1:07:49 | William Papantoniou: Alpha Zero is cooler than AlphaGo
1:07:52 | TEJ4321 Tejas: just watch the matrix lmao
1:08:06 | Jman: There's no documentary on zero ;-;\
1:08:15 | Jman: Or master for that matter
1:08:20 | William Papantoniou: saddd
1:09:09 | Justin Kim: gpt 3
1:09:11 | Izy Z: Hey I have read snow crash 😀 
1:09:13 | Hussain Nawaz: If we fail our exams playing hr machine, we know who to blame
1:09:19 | Justin Kim: pog ai ^ 
1:09:25 | (Moderator) Michael Gribben: 🙂
1:09:52 | (Owner) Marc Chee: I was actually playing the sequel to Human Resource Machine last night
1:10:09 | (Owner) Marc Chee: it's called 7 Billion Humans and it's based on parallel coding . . . lots of fun
1:10:19 | Blake Morris: Oooh nice
1:10:21 | フワフワ: HRM is so fun
1:10:48 | Blake Morris: I haven't played that one yet
1:11:39 | Olli Bowers: that game is really cool
1:11:58 | (Owner) Marc Chee: One day I'm going to contact the devs of the game and try to figure out how many sales I've gotten them 😛
1:11:58 | Blake Morris: TIS-100 is another assembly-based game
1:12:15 | (Owner) Marc Chee: although I think they're pretty famous, so I feel like we're just a drop in an ocean
1:12:35 | Hussain Nawaz: Anyone hve an estimate on how long the game is?
1:12:45 | Blake Morris: Yeah, they also did World of Goo so they're not a small developer
1:12:45 | (Owner) Marc Chee: On Steam, there's a category called "Programming Games" or something similar which has a whole bunch of this stuff
1:13:39 | Blake Morris: There was this DS game called WarioWare DIY that I made some fancy stuff in
1:14:05 | Lorenzo Grillo: what????
1:14:11 | (Moderator) Michael Gribben: Game of Life is a pretty cool game 🙂
1:14:23 | Lorenzo Grillo: people who make programs know programming???
1:14:32 | Hamish Cox: theres a game called screeps where you program little workers using js and use them to maintain a colony and raid other players
1:14:39 | Hamish Cox: you can only interact via code
1:14:49 | Lewis Bandas: a gigabyte of ram will do the trick 
1:14:53 | Mohammed Hossain: mr robot
1:15:23 | Hamish Cox: r/itsaunixsystem
1:15:24 | Brendon Z: Play DEFCON if you like Wargames
1:15:52 | Alan Chan: live code?
1:15:53 | Hamish Cox: uplink was best hacking game (from the defcon devs too)
1:16:07 | Olli Bowers: minecraft redstone?
1:16:12 | TEJ4321 Tejas: ^^^
1:16:13 | Hamish Cox: UPDATE 4 RELEASED THO
1:16:25 | Hussain Nawaz: @Hamish Cox do you know much js knowledge do you need in advance for screeps
1:16:26 | (Moderator) Michael Gribben: oh yes I know some people learnt programming via minecraft redstone
1:16:27 | Blake Morris: Good video on this type of game
1:16:45 | EdIsAmbro: except EA. made by suits
1:16:50 | Scire Schroedinger: make satisfactory a content for the channel
1:16:51 | TEJ4321 Tejas: @Olli Bowers minecraft command blocks was the first coding language i learnt
1:17:02 | FEIYUE MA: lol
1:17:06 | Hamish Cox: @Hussain Nawaz quite a bit imo. it markets itself as a way to learn programming, but you won't get far without much. theres a free version that you can give a shot
1:17:15 | Jman: Everyone has to buy minecraft first
1:17:27 | Olli Bowers: @TEJ4321 Tejas hahahaha
1:17:31 | Matthew Richards: It would be good for learning computer architecture with bare bones redstone. Transistor level stuff
1:17:33 | FEIYUE MA: Minecraft command is truly a new language
1:17:41 | Hussain Nawaz: @Hamish Cox that's a shame, maybe I'll come back to it later in the degree
1:18:19 | Scire Schroedinger: Marc Chee's minecraft monarchy empire
1:19:15 | Hussain Nawaz: Marc suffering from success
1:20:26 | (Moderator) Michael Gribben: yes
1:20:59 | Lorenzo Grillo: you shouldn't set head for the subsequent ones
1:21:12 | Lorenzo Grillo: wouldn't that screw up the order?
1:21:50 | Lorenzo Grillo: actually no it wouldn't, but the function sets that anyway
1:22:26 | (Moderator) Michael Gribben: ahh so insert_after returns head which in most cases is the same thing... unless it's an empty list (ie NULL)
1:22:37 | (Moderator) Michael Gribben: oh marc just said that hahah
1:22:52 | Lorenzo Grillo: you shouldn't have head = at front
1:23:19 | Jman: Ms paint strats
1:23:41 | Anneliese Menday: Long ago, the four nations lived together in harmony. Then, everything changed when the Fire Nation attacked. 
1:24:15 | (Moderator) Michael Gribben: @Lorenzo Grillo sorry not sure what you mean... insert_after just returns head
1:24:31 | (Moderator) Michael Gribben: head is like the front of the linked list
1:25:31 | Zijie Li: which sorting method are we using today 
1:25:41 | TEJ4321 Tejas: bogo sort
1:25:49 | TEJ4321 Tejas: the only true method
1:25:56 | Lorenzo Grillo: well yeah insert_after returns head, if you give "head" as the argument for insert_pos in the function
1:25:57 | Hussain Nawaz: bogosrt
1:26:00 | (Moderator) Michael Gribben: the C makers really didn't like their vowels...
1:26:17 | Lorenzo Grillo: if you give, say, "head->next", it'll return "head->next" right?
1:26:36 | Lorenzo Grillo: unless you give NULL it just returns whatever you gave as insert_pos
1:26:43 | (Moderator) Michael Gribben: @Zijie Li we're not really using a sorting method.. we're just inserting it so it's always sorted
1:27:04 | Zijie Li: Ah ok
1:27:12 | (Moderator) Michael Gribben: yep 🙂
1:27:30 | TEJ4321 Tejas: if the sort time is O(∞) then its high efficiency right 🙂 @Michael Gribben 
1:27:54 | (Moderator) Michael Gribben: 🤔
1:28:48 | (Moderator) Michael Gribben: Hopefully you don't get a "Execution stopped by CPU time limit" 😛
1:29:15 | Hussain Nawaz: Can't we have pointers two ways in a linked list?
1:29:26 | Hussain Nawaz: So one pointing to next and one pointing to previous
1:29:36 | (Moderator) Michael Gribben: yes we can!
1:29:43 | (Moderator) Michael Gribben: That's called a doubly linked list!
1:29:49 | Zijie Li: yes
1:30:02 | (Moderator) Michael Gribben: because each 'node' has 2 pointers - one to the thing before it and one to the thing after it
1:30:47 | (Moderator) Michael Gribben: They're a bit harder to implement but allow us to do more fancy stuff (like inserting beforehand)
1:37:08 | Hussain Nawaz: Won't it be &&?
1:37:11 | Lorenzo Grillo: tutorialspoint good one
1:37:26 | Zijie Li: I think && make sense
1:37:32 | TEJ4321 Tejas: can we use the internet in exams
1:37:38 | Keith: targette advertising :P
1:38:15 | Scire Schroedinger: @TEJ4321 Tejas shhhhhh
1:38:35 | (Moderator) Michael Gribben: 👀
1:38:42 | Lorenzo Grillo: shouldnt it be &&
1:39:10 | mrmango303: will we have to memorise standard library functions for the exam?
1:39:40 | (Moderator) Michael Gribben: ^^ nope
1:40:00 | (Moderator) Michael Gribben: you will at least have access to the terminal (and the man pages) in the sxam
1:41:02 | Zijie Li: I think we can also compare with curr - > next -> name ? And then we can insert after current.
1:41:45 | Lorenzo Grillo: @Zijie Li what if curr->next = NULL?
1:42:10 | Zijie Li: ye 
1:45:42 | Lorenzo Grillo: shouldnt it be higher?
1:46:01 | Lorenzo Grillo: because we want to keep going until the second is higher
1:47:40 | Lorenzo Grillo: but we want "keep going if new name LOWER than "curr->name"
1:47:46 | Lorenzo Grillo: dont we?
1:47:54 | Lorenzo Grillo: or have i got this the wrong way around?
1:48:02 | Art Smart: What about alphabetical ordering of matt and marc
1:48:37 | (Moderator) Michael Gribben: @Art Smart the strcmp function loops through matt and marc
1:48:50 | Reiji: does strcmp compare the first character or the whole string?
1:48:55 | Hussain Nawaz: is strcmp case sensitive?
1:49:22 | (Moderator) Michael Gribben: compares 'm' vs'm', then 'a' vs 'a', then there's a showdown between 'a' and 'r'
1:49:50 | Lorenzo Grillo: imma do a preemptive "HE'S BEHIND YOU" since im still not sure about that <0 or >0 thing
1:50:08 | (Moderator) Michael Gribben: @Reiji it compares the whole string 🙂
1:50:39 | (Moderator) Michael Gribben: @Hussain Nawaz it's case sensitive
1:50:57 | (Moderator) Michael Gribben: there is strcasecmp that ignores case
1:57:15 | William Papantoniou: surely there is a library that handles all this code for us right? cause this code is more or less universal?
1:57:17 | Brendon Z: so its sort of similar to incrementing a counter?
1:57:53 | JianFeng Lin: pain
1:58:45 | (Moderator) Michael Gribben: doing curr = curr->next is very similar to incrementing a counter! @Brendon Z 
1:59:07 | (Moderator) Michael Gribben: it's the linkedin list equivalent of i++ 🙂
1:59:12 | (Moderator) Michael Gribben: *linked
2:00:03 | Raiyan Ahmed: i understand what we are doing byt the syntax is getting my head
2:00:19 | Art Smart: is it hard to insert names via user input
2:00:19 | Brendon Z: thanks @Michael Gribben 
2:01:06 | Blake Morris: newlines
2:01:31 | (Moderator) Michael Gribben: @Art Smart you should get a string from the user via something like fgets? Then pass that line into insert_alpha.
2:02:40 | Alan Chan: live code please
2:03:21 | Daniel Lin: if u just reboot ur computer does that auto free the memory ?
2:03:34 | Art Smart: The zip file on the assignment 2 page is unavailable to download
2:03:36 | (Owner) Marc Chee: http://web.cse.unsw.edu.au/~marcchee/lecture13/
2:03:41 | (Moderator) Michael Gribben: http://web.cse.unsw.edu.au/~marcchee/lecture13/
2:03:45 | Alan Chan: thx
2:03:50 | Scire Schroedinger: 🥲
2:03:58 | Hussain Nawaz: Tnank you!
2:04:01 | Xykeal: thx
2:04:04 | Olli Bowers: when the program ends it frees the memory right?
2:04:13 | William Papantoniou: @Marc Chee Glib.h handles linked lists, like appends, inserts, making generic ones basically a lot of things. thought I would let u know
2:04:27 | (Moderator) Michael Gribben: @Daniel Lin yep! These memory leaks are in RAM which gets wiped after you shut down your computer 🙂
2:04:32 | Mag1c: Nah, we are leaking memory rn
2:05:31 | (Moderator) Michael Gribben: @Olli Bowers yep! The operating system should clean it up 🙂 It's still very good practice though... some programs run for a very long time...
2:05:34 | Daniel Lin: Thanks 🙂 
2:05:40 | (Moderator) Michael Gribben: like browsers
2:06:32 | Olli Bowers: chrome 😞
2:07:02 | (Moderator) Michael Gribben: @Art Smart interesting.. I'll pass that along..
2:07:40 | Olli Bowers: oooooo
2:14:14 | Lorenzo Grillo: my brain isnt too frazzled
